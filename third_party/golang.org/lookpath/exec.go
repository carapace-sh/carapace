// Package exec runs external commands. It wraps os.StartProcess to make it
// easier to remap stdin and stdout, connect I/O with pipes, and do other
// adjustments.
//
// Unlike the "system" library call from C and other languages, the
// os/exec package intentionally does not invoke the system shell and
// does not expand any glob patterns or handle other expansions,
// pipelines, or redirections typically done by shells. The package
// behaves more like C's "exec" family of functions. To expand glob
// patterns, either call the shell directly, taking care to escape any
// dangerous input, or use the path/filepath package's Glob function.
// To expand environment variables, use package os's ExpandEnv.
//
// Note that the examples in this package assume a Unix system.
// They may not run on Windows, and they do not run in the Go Playground
// used by golang.org and godoc.org.
//
// # Executables in the current directory
//
// The functions Command and LookPath look for a program
// in the directories listed in the current path, following the
// conventions of the host operating system.
// Operating systems have for decades included the current
// directory in this search, sometimes implicitly and sometimes
// configured explicitly that way by default.
// Modern practice is that including the current directory
// is usually unexpected and often leads to security problems.
//
// To avoid those security problems, as of Go 1.19, this package will not resolve a program
// using an implicit or explicit path entry relative to the current directory.
// That is, if you run exec.LookPath("go"), it will not successfully return
// ./go on Unix nor .\go.exe on Windows, no matter how the path is configured.
// Instead, if the usual path algorithms would result in that answer,
// these functions return an error err satisfying errors.Is(err, ErrDot).
//
// For example, consider these two program snippets:
//
//	path, err := exec.LookPath("prog")
//	if err != nil {
//		log.Fatal(err)
//	}
//	use(path)
//
// and
//
//	cmd := exec.Command("prog")
//	if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil {
//		log.Fatal(err)
//	}
//
// These will not find and run ./prog or .\prog.exe,
// no matter how the current path is configured.
//
// Code that always wants to run a program from the current directory
// can be rewritten to say "./prog" instead of "prog".
//
// Code that insists on including results from relative path entries
// can instead override the error using an errors.Is check:
//
//	path, err := exec.LookPath("prog")
//	if errors.Is(err, exec.ErrDot) {
//		err = nil
//	}
//	if err != nil {
//		log.Fatal(err)
//	}
//	use(path)
//
// and
//
//	cmd := exec.Command("prog")
//	if errors.Is(cmd.Err, exec.ErrDot) {
//		cmd.Err = nil
//	}
//	if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil {
//		log.Fatal(err)
//	}
//
// Setting the environment variable GODEBUG=execerrdot=0
// disables generation of ErrDot entirely, temporarily restoring the pre-Go 1.19
// behavior for programs that are unable to apply more targeted fixes.
// A future version of Go may remove support for this variable.
//
// Before adding such overrides, make sure you understand the
// security implications of doing so.
// See https://go.dev/blog/path-security for more information.

	// call the Kill method on the command's Process.
	//
	// Typically a custom Cancel will send a signal to the command's
	// Process, but it may instead take other actions to initiate cancellation,
	// such as closing a stdin or stdout pipe or sending a shutdown request on a
	// network socket.
	//
	// If the command exits with a success status after Cancel is
	// called, and Cancel does not return an error equivalent to

	// returns an error that wraps os.ErrProcessDone, Wait and similar methods
	// continue to return the command's usual exit status.)
	//

	// its I/O pipes unclosed.
	//
	// The WaitDelay timer starts when either the associated Context is done or a
	// call to Wait observes that the child process has exited, whichever occurs
	// first. When the delay has elapsed, the command shuts down the child process
	// and/or its I/O pipes.
	//
	// If the child process has failed to exit â€” perhaps because it ignored or
	// failed to receive a shutdown signal from a Cancel function, or because no
	// Cancel function was set â€” then it will be terminated using os.Process.Kill.
	//
	// Then, if the I/O pipes communicating with the child process are still open,
	// those pipes are closed in order to unblock any goroutines currently blocked
	// on Read or Write calls.
	//
	// If pipes are closed due to WaitDelay, no Cancel call has occurred,
	// and the command has otherwise exited with a successful status, Wait and
	// similar methods will return ErrWaitDelay instead of nil.
